## Part 2: Create a game
 Read the Software Requirements Specification (Software\_requirements\_spec.pdf) for the game prototype. **1. Design an algorithm** Design an algorithm using pseudocode or a flowchart to meet the program specifications. Your algorithm must use appropriate constructs. **2. Develop the game** Develop the game according to your algorithm using Python. Ensure that you:
- comment your code clearly
- apply relevant programming techniques and constructs to create a clear and concise code
- use an appropriate library function.
**3. Test and evaluate the game** Test the game to ensure that it works correctly and according to the specifications. Document the following using the ROI Software test report (ROI\_Software\_test\_report.docx).
1. Create the test cases for testing.

1. Conduct the testing and include screenshots. **Note: To show this is your machine, use Sticky Notes (Windows) or an equivalent tool to record your name and ensure you capture the sticky note in the screen shot.**

1. Evaluate how well your software meets the software specifications. Include explanations of why you chose specific syntax in your coding and what criteria you used.
**4. Obtain sign-off** Demonstrate the game to your supervisor and:
- confirm that the game meets the software specifications
- btain user sign-off, using your completed ROI Software test report.
